# Paul/Alex System File (August 2023)

2 over 1**:** 1 any 2 any is GF

Partner bids normally but a low-level response could still hide a bigger
hand. Any jump by opener or reverse by opener still shows extra values,
but any jump to game would suggest an unsuitable hand for a slam so
weakness.

Change of suit bid at 2 level over a response by opener**: -**

1D 1 major 2C could hide a bigger hand and is semi-forcing to 2D but
opener will likely have 4 clubs.

1H 1S 2 minor could hide a bigger hand and is semi-forcing to 2 major
noting responders should only pass with minimum and much more cards in
the minor. Even with 3 minor 1 major distribution responder should show
preference to the major.

## Weak bids and weak jump overcalls

Should comprise mostly of values in suit bid and not outside Aces and
Kings.

Defence to Short Club/Diamond and if they play transfer responses**.**

This is nearly always played two or more ways and includes a weak NT so
chance of them having the minor is diminished to less than 50% therefore
we 2 of their minors as natural, but it remains important to show majors
so double is take-out and 3 of their minor is Michaels showing both
majors. All other bids are as system so simple overcalls and weak jump
overcalls. 1NT is 15-18 balanced.

If they play transfer responses, then double shows the suit they have
bid and bidding the suit they are transferring into shows a hand with a
double for take-out.

## Defence to Strong Club/Diamond

One level overcalls are natural. 1NT shows minors with 2NT showing more
minors. 2C is 5+4+ clubs and higher suit, 2D is 5+4+M, 2H is majors, 2S
is natural and a weak jump overcall like 3 bids. The suits are either
way round, but we are more likely to compete if competing weaker when 5
card suit is one bid.

## Puppet Stayman over 2NT and over 2C opener and subsequent 2NT by opener

3C asks for 4 and 5 card majors 3NT response denies either M. 3M shows
that Major 5 cards. 3D shows one 4 card major, and responder bids the
major he does not have 4 cards in. If responder has both majors he bids
4D asking opener to play in his 4 card major.

1C 1D 1H 1S is natural and forcing for one round opener should bid
accordingly. After 1H in same sequence 2S is 4sf to game.

## Leaping and non-Leaping Michaels

We play defence of 4 of minor after weak 2’s and weak 3’s of Majors as
Michaels showing that minor and 5 of the other major and normally
constructive. If partner bids another suit below game level that is a
cue and interested in a slam in one of the suits.

Ogust: 2X – 2NT

> 3C – Weak pts, weak suit
> 
> 3D – Strong pts, weak suit
> 
> 3H –Weak pts, strong suit
> 
> 3S – Strong pts, strong suit

Ogust is also be used after a weak jump shift, and a 2<sup>nd</sup> seat
weak 2H/2S jump overcall.

After inverted minor: 1C – 2C (10+ points, 4+ card support)

Opener can bid the next step to show 12-14 balanced: 1C – 2C – 2D

1C – 2C – 2NT shows 18-19 balanced

Swedish responses to Jacoby: 1M – 2NT (GF)

3C – Any minimum

3D – Asks for shortage

3H/S/NT – Shortage in C/D/oM respectively

4C/D(/H) – Natural, good suit

4M – Nothing else

3M – 5+ cards

3oM – cues

3NT – start cueing; serious slam interest

4C/D – cues

4M – nothing else

3D – Balanced, extras

3M – slam interest

3oM – cue

3NT – serious slam try

4C/D – cue

4M – Nothing else, barely GF

3H/S/NT – Shortage in C/D/oM and extras

4C/D(/H) – Good side suit, usually 5 cards and extras

Bergen raises: After 1M

3C – good 9 to poor 12 points, 3 card support

3D – 9-11 points, 4 card support

3 level suit bids below agreed suit are game tries and show values in
the suit bid.

After 1M: Double jumps are splinters with 9-12 pts (stronger hands bid
2NT to GF).

Triple jumps below game (of by implication the agreed suit) show a void.
Any triple jump above game (of by implication the agreed suit) is asking
partner for responses to exclusion Key card Blackwood. Responses are as
follows: - next suit 0/3, 1, 2, 2 and Q.

Two-way checkback: 1C – 1H – 1NT (12-14pts, balanced)

2C – Invitational with 5+ cards in first bid suit or 4-4 in spades and
hearts?

2D – Forced relay

Pass – Weak hand with 5+diamonds

2H – 5+H, invitational, not suitable for any other bid (so 6H or 5H4D)

> 2S – 4S 5H invitational

2N – 5H, balanced, invitational

3C – 5H 4+C invitational (opener’s suit, so four clubs is sufficient)

3D – 5H 5D invitational (new suit, so 5-5 distribution necessary)

3NT – 5332, choice of games

2D – Game forcing, artificial enquiry (shows either 5 hearts or 3 spades
or both)

2H – three-card support

2S – four cards (denies three-card support)

2NT – neither of the above

3m – natural, suitable

## 2NT rebid

We play checkback after a 2NT rebid: 3C asks opener for length in the
majors.

After a 2/1 response, 2NT is 12-14 OR 18-19 balanced. With the stronger
hand, player should make an extra try after game has been bid e.g., 1H –
2C – 2NT – 3NT – 4NT (Quantitative)

## Transfer breaks

Major suit transfers: 1NT – 2D/H

2NT – balanced maximum 4+ card support

3M – Completing to 3 level. 4+ card support, weaker range.

New suit – 4+ card support with 3+ OK side suit maximum

Minor suit transfers: 1NT – 2S/NT

2NT/3C – Less than 3 card support and less than Ax or Kx

3C/3D – Completing transfer. 3+ card support (or Ax or Kx)

> New suit after transfer by responder – Shortage with game-forcing
> values

Wriggle (after penalty double over 1NT)

Pass – forces XX then responder bids lower of two non-touching suits

              2X – 44 in suit bid and next higher suit

                             Opener passes or corrects

XX – 5 card suit

2C – Forced relay. Responder passes or corrects.

## Interference over the response to 1NT

X over Stayman: 1NT – (P) – 2C – (X)

Pass – 4+ C to an honour then redouble is to play

2D – 4+ D denies 4 clubs to an honour

2H/2S – Show the majors (like normal Stayman responses)

XX – shows club stop (not denying 4 card major so bidding suits in
ascending order afterwards is fine)

Overcall over Stayman: 1NT – (P) – 2C – (2X)

P is normal as partner could be weak. Any bid shows maximum 5M or 6m but
is unlikely.

X over Major Transfer: 1NT – (P) – 2D/H – (X)

Pass – 4+ to at least one honour in doubled suit less than 3 card
support

2M – minimum, no support for partner

XX – three card support for partner

Transfer breaks still apply exactly as without the intervention.

Overcall over Major Transfer: 1NT – (P) – 2D/H – (2/3X)

Pass – 2 card support for the transfer major

X – Competitive, 3+ card support

3M – Any 4 card support

Transfer breaks still apply, but it may not be possible to use some of
the bids

1M – 2NT 55m

3C – 5+ oM

3D – 3+ card support, strong

3M – 3+ card support, weak

X shows willingness to double one of their two suits

1D – (2D) - In Michael’s, shows 55M

2H – 5+ C

2S – 4+ D

X shows willingness to double one of their two suits

Multi-Landy (defence to 1NT opening)

2C – (P): Note 2C shows both majors or a diamond overcall. Responses: -

2D - to play if partner is showing diamonds (2C bidder corrects to 2H
with both majors)

2H - to play if partner has both majors, but a good raise if partner has
diamonds

> 2S - to play if partner has both majors, but a good raise if partner
> has diamonds and support for hearts.

> 
> 3D - diamonds, minimum
> 
> 3H - better hearts than spades
> 
> 3S - better spades than hearts
> 
> 3NT - diamonds, non-minimum

3C - natural, forcing in principle

3D - raise to 3D or to at least three in one of the majors 

(1NT) 2D\* (P): Note 2D shows single suited major or both minors.
Responses: -

  2H - pass or correct (correcting to 2NT shows both minors)

> 2S - to play opposite spades and a raise to at least 3H (2D bidder
> bids 2NT to show both minors)

2NT – asking

3C/H - hearts, max/min

> 3D/S - spades, max/min
> 
> 3NT = minors

3C - to play opposite both minors and a raise to at least three in both
majors

3D – to play opposite both minors and a raise to at least three in both
majors

3C – minimum with clubs

3D – minimum with diamonds

3H – game-forcing with clubs

3S – game-forcing with diamonds

3C pass-or-correct

2NT is a strong 2 suiter

Michael’s overcall: (1M) – 2M (5oM and 5m or better, 8+ pts)

2NT is an invitational-plus enquiry

3C – minimum with clubs

3D – minimum with diamonds

3H – game-forcing with clubs

3S – game-forcing with diamonds

1NT opening:

4C – 5+/5+ majors, weak or slam-going response 4D is minimum less than 3
card support for either suit.

## Lebensohl

We play Lebensohl after a double of their weak 2 and after their
overcall (even if artificial) of our 1NT. This forces 3C unless the
doubler is strong enough to break this.

Fit Jump**:**

By passed hand over partners opening bid and over partners’ overcall.
This shows support for partners suit and a good side suit normally 5+
cards and is invitational to game. We also play this after partners
opening bid is doubled or over an overcall by partner.

Drury**:**

We play 2C over a 3<sup>rd</sup> or 4<sup>th</sup> in hand 1M opener as
asking for strength of the opening bid showing some game interest by
passed hand so support. Partner will sign off in 2M if weak and bid 2D
if stronger or above 2M.

## Redouble for Rescue

Occurs on low level contracts and asks partner to save to another suit
(can even follow a psyche).

## 2C Opener Responses

2D less than 8 points so less than an Ace and King. 2NT would then be a
second negative or 3NT if partner bids 3C/3D. Immediate 2NT is 8-10
balanced, 2 major or 3 minor is positive nearly always 5 cards 3NT
(11-13 balanced). 3H/3S/4C/4D solid suit missing one honour.

## Triple jumps and exclusion RKCB 

A triple jump above game level is exclusion Blackwood with responses
(0-3,1,2,2+Q) including 1H 4S. In competition, a jump cue bid above game
is exclusion so 1S (2C) 4C is a splinter raise, while 1S (2C) 5C is
exclusion. DOPI ROPI applies. Responses to Exclusion are 0/3, 1, 2, 2+Q.

## Quantitative Raise of 2NT

Immediate 4NT is clearly quantitative but also after a transfer and
partner does not show support 4NT is quantitative and also after 3S
(minors) 3NT 4NT is still quantitative so 4 of minor is slamming in that
minor after 3S 3NT.
