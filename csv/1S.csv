1S - 5-card major,"1NT - Up to poor 12, NF",2C - Gazzilli (Weak with clubs or 17+ HCP. explained below),2D - 8+ HCP with any shape,Opener either rebids their major showing the weak option so 5+ spades and 4+ clubs 11-14 any other bid 17+ GF.
Note that all 17+ hands go through Gazzilli.,,"If opener rebids 3NT after Gazzilli it shows 18-19 balanced, 5M332. 2NT rebid shows 15-17 balanced with 5M332 and the major suit is good.",,
Priorities. Responder with a weak hand should first look to bid a 7+ suit of their own then two of opener's major with 2+ support finally a shorter suit or three-suited hand.,,If defenders double Gazzilli 2C responder passes showing OK clubs and redoubles to show 8+.,2H - 5-7 HCP with 5+ hearts,They have a tight range of hands and opener is usually well placed to pick the contract or invite.
